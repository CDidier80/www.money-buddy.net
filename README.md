## Description

This app was inspired by needs of many friends, family and others who desire greater control over their personal financial planning; Informed, USER-controlled financial insights should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their familiarity with spreadsheet software.

This full-stack web app is designed to make personal financial planning both easy and comprehensive. A simple and intuitive user-interface lays atop sophisticated, automated financial planning logic that provide valuable analysis and reporting on each user's unique situation.

The UI is comprised of a toolset of financial widgets. At this state of development, the app covers the topics of budgeting, cashflows, and retirement planning - with many more features on the way.
